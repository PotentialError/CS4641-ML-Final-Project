# CS4641-ML-Final-Project

Final Project for the Georgia Institute of Technology's CS 4641: Introduction to Machine Learning

Created by Michael Rodyushkin and Nathaniel Wert

Project Details: Using a [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthss/crop-recommendation-dataset), we set out to determine which common supervised learning models would best predict the right plant to grow for a certain area. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate if stacking the best models into a singular ensemble model would produce the best results. Our investigation and end results can be found in the "ML Final Project Report.pdf" and all of the code referenced in the report can be found in "CS4641_Final.ipynb".
